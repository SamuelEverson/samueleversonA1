			<h1>Profile</h1>
			<h3>Myers-Brigs Type Indicator (MBTI)</h3>
			<p>Via the below link I have undertaken a MBTI test. 
			<p><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality?fbclid=IwAR08x7rMSca1ZGxXh5GVLLDnqqyi4ani8FfyibeiBAuf-CHAPKhJYnm6NtM">http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality?fbclid=IwAR08x7rMSca1ZGxXh5GVLLDnqqyi4ani8FfyibeiBAuf-CHAPKhJYnm6NtM</a>
			<p>My result is INTJ
			<p><strong>I</strong>ntrovert(38%)  i<strong>N</strong>tuitive(9%)  <strong>T</strong>hinking(16%)  <strong>J</strong>udging(22%)
			<h4>What does this result say about me?*</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>I am suited to roles where I can work alone or as part of a small group exceptionally well. </li>
			<li>I dislike the ‘who you know not what you know’ theory.</li>
			<li>I like to get work done the right way to a high standard.</li>
			<li>I don’t respect people that don’t pull their weight. </li>
			<li>I am open minded and can be a ‘Jack-of-all-trades’.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>*Answers derived from <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/intj">http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/intj</a>
			<h3>Personality Test</h3>
			<p>Based on a personality test taken at https://www.16personalities.com</p>
			<p>My result is: <strong>Mediator - INFP-T</strong></p>
			<p>This is very similar to my MBTI results with the difference of feeling over thinking.
			<br/>I feel the results mean the same about me as the MBTI results. 
			<h3>Learning types test</h3>
			<p>Based on a learning styles test taken at <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml</a></p>
			<p>My result is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Auditory: 40%</li>
				<li>Visual: 35%</li>
				<li>Tactile: 25%</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>What does this mean about me?</h4>
			<p>I learn better by hearing (though I feel with some things I learn better by doing).</p>
			<p>This means for me things like video lectures, music and speakers are optimal learning mechanisms for me.</p>
			<h4>What does this all mean for me and teamwork?</h4>
			<p>I think I’d make an excellent leader in a team however I tend not to strive for such positions as I prefer to have my tasks set and complete them accurately without worrying about what everyone else is doing.</p>
			<p>I’m easy to work with and strive for the best outcome for myself and the team. I’m less likely to engage with team members that are not pulling their weight.</p>
			<p>I engage well with discussions which would include project planning and working out task assignment. 
			When forming a team it would be ideal to find likeminded people as similar personality traits would work well together sharing the same goals and dedication.</p>
