			<h1>Interest in IT </h1>
			<h3>What, when and why? </h3>
			<p/>My interest in IT began approximately 12 years ago towards the end of my high school years. I’d always been interested in electronic devices but didn’t have the first clue about how they worked. 
			<p/>When I moved from the Central Coast of NSW to Northern NSW I chose ICT and then IPT as high school electives and this is where the interest really began. 
			<p/>A family friend at the time who has worked as an IT industry expert for many years and teaches IT with the NSW Department of Education & Training, introduced me further into the realm of IT. 
			<p/>With this friend, I built my first desktop PC using old parts he had laying around at his place. This was my first taste of exploring computer hardware and the passion only grew from there. 
			<p/>After completing high school I furthered my IT path by completing a Diploma of IT at TAFE. During this time I purchased all new parts and upgraded my PC with a new build. 
			<p/>In more recent years, and with the knowledge built up from these experiences I have further explored programming during my past employment, specifically with the VBA language and this has sparked my interest into a wildfire. I was fascinated with the way programming could automate such tedious and complex tasks to help end users in doing their work more efficiently and confidently. 
			<p/>From there I have explored other concepts including with other languages and am excited to learn more in a more structured environment! 
			<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
			<p/>I chose to study at RMIT as I understand RMIT is a great place to study! I was limited in selection as I was studying online and only part time but I’m very happy to have RMIT as my choice.
			<h3>Expectations?</h3>
			<p/>I’m hoping to create a better understanding of IT as a whole and prepare myself to begin a career down the IT path. I’m not yet sure which way to go but am currently considering either software engineer or database administration. I’m sure throughout the degree with RMIT I’ll have plenty of guidance and experiences to help me find my way. 
			<p/>I’m looking forward to the structure of university study vs. me studying/learning on my own – I often find I get lost trying to learn more complicated things as I just don’t know where to start.
