			<p/>I conducted quite a thorough search but wasn’t very convinced by most jobs I found. I put this mostly to my lack of understanding and experience, or simply, I don’t really know what I’m looking for.
			<p/>The <above/below> link is a job advertisement that I enjoyed reading and would happily apply for (providing I had the necessary skills). 
			<p/>Should the advertisement no-longer be available, please click here [insert hyperlink to image of the advertisement] to view an image of the advertisement. 
			<h3>What is the job?</h3> 
			<p/>The position requires a C++ developer who loves problem solving. The employer is seeking someone who has the mindset of the whole system, not just the app or section they are working on. 
			<p/>The ad indicates to me the job will require the ability to work in teams and independently, along with working with others outside of a team environment (such as stakeholders etc.). Experience would help (including experience with C++) but you don’t require expertise in the field which shows me there are entry level positions available. 
			<p/>I currently do not have any experience with C++ but do have very little experience with Java and C#. I have no formal qualifications with software engineering. I only have experience in other simpler languages such as VBA and web based programming such as HTML/CSS. 
			<p/>I plan to learn key skills such as working in a team within the IT industry, further my project management skills and of course learn programming concepts and languages via my studies at RMIT.
